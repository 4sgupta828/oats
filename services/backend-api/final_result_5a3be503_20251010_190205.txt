UFFLOW REACTOR - FINAL RESULTS
================================================================================
Goal: write a worldle game cli based
Completion Reason: Successfully implemented a CLI-based Wordle game with the following features:
1. Random word selection from curated list
2. Six attempts to guess the word
3. Input validation for 5-letter words
4. Colored output showing correct (green), present (yellow), and absent (gray) letters
5. Interactive gameplay with clear user feedback
6. Win/lose conditions with appropriate messages

The game executes properly and waits for user input, making it ready for play. The timeout during testing is expected behavior for an interactive game.
Turns Completed: 8
Execution Time: 2025-10-10 18:59:47 - 2025-10-10 19:02:05
